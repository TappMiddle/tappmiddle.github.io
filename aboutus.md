“I have always expressed myself best through writing” (Keys).  This quote, written by Alicia Keys, is true for many people. Writing is a great way to get in touch with one’s real feelings. Whatever the reason one may write, if writing comes from an honest place, it can bring awareness and be cathartic. This is the intention of this blog. Each week a topic will be introduced, and students will have the opportunity to write responses and comments. We hope to capture the honest thoughts and feelings on the topics presented so that all responders can become more self-aware through the reading and writing on this blog. 
Please demonstrate courtesy, respect, and appropriate use of language when using this blog.
