“I have always expressed myself best through writing” (Keys).  Alicia keys wrote this quote; This is true for many people. Writing is a great way to get in touch with one’s real feelings. Whatever the reason one may write, if it comes from an honest place, it can bring awareness and be cathartic. This discussion board for 8th grade will be presented weekly to capture the honest thoughts on the topics introduced. However, please demonstrate courtesy, respect and, appropriate use of language when using this blog.
